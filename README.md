I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. 
I also hold a masterâ€™s degree from the same institution. My main area of expertise is Comparative 
Political Behavior and, more specifically, intergroup behavior. This means that I investigate how 
people interact in different settings, ranging from political polarization in elections around 
the world to inter-agency conflicts in public administration (which I call bureaucratic 
polarization).
